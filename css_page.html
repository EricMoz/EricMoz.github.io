                            Find the font you want and copy the code given below. You can rename it to anything you want in the font-family declaration. It uses the link source to get the font from google.
                            <br><br>
                            Place the code at the top of your CSS (the order matters). Once the @font-face at-rule is defined, you can use the font-family type in your stylesheet!

            <p>In this article, you will learn about wireframes and prototypes: what they are, why they're useful and how they're involved with the user experience design process. This is helpful if you'd like to understand the design process before development and how multiple iterations of a design must be critiqued and revised in order to present the ideal product to the user. <br><br>
