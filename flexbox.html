            <p>When designing a website, the grid comprises three major components: columns, gutters, and margins.</p>

            <p><strong>Columns</strong>: are defined as the vertical sections that span the width of a page. In web design, it's common to see layouts consisting of 12 or 16 columns, while other may only feature three columns. Defining the number of columns depends on what's appropriate for your design, device, and or screen viewing size.</p>
                
            <p>Next, a <strong>gutter</strong> is the negative space between each column. Gutters help in ensuring the columns don't run together, which would negate the purpose of using a column-based grid. Gutters make up the negative space between columns. This design element helps to provide a natural break between elements aligned horizontally, while also helping to break rows of content vertically.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Margins</strong> appear on the left and right sides of the column-based grid. These ensure the content of your designs doesn't match up to the edges of the browser window.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Grid Rows</strong>: are the horizontal lines on a grid. Think of rows as invisible boxes that groups content together by height. Rows are commonly used in web designs to group content together and re-order other content to allow for more whitespace.</p>

            <div id="responsive"></div>
            <h2 class="h2green">Responsive Grid</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When designing web content, a designer needs to take into account the different screen-sizes a user might encounter and how that will affect a website's layout. Many websites utilize responsive design, a set of techniques that allow a website's content to shift based on the device or screen size. Because of these changes, responsive design requires a different number of total columns based on screen size, in order to accommodate content and keep it from being squished.</p>

            <p>Consider your mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Now think about their viewable areas. All are substantially different in size. Thus, it's common practice in web design to create responsive grid sizes. On a large or desktop device you may start with a 12 column grid, but on a small or mobile device, you adjust the 12 column grid to a 4 column grid.</p>
                
            <p>As a designer, responsive grid design enables you to maximize the content on the screen, ensuring a more accessible experience for users. Additionally, your design elements will have sufficient space to breathe and content can naturally flow across the page.</p>

                        This property is declared directly on the flex items and not the container itself (in ratio/proportion form).

                            The default value of flex-shrink is 1, which is why items shrink automatically if not declared otherwise.<br><br>
                            
                            Keep in mind, minimum and maximum widths will take precedence over flex-grow and flex-shrink.

                            Another way of specifying the width of a flex item is with the flex-basis property. It allows us to specify the width of an item before it stretches or shrinks. We can think of flex-basis as the width OR height (depending on flex-direction) of our flex items before they are constrained by a flex container. <a href="flex-basis.png" title="Click to see an illustrative example" target="_blank">Visual Example of minimize versus full screen</a>
                            <br><br>
                            Also, a few notes about using flex-basis and width/height:<br><br>

                            - flex-basis is limited by both max-width/max-height and min-width/min-height<br><br>
                            - When declared, flex-basis will override the width/height property set on a flex container<br><br>
                            - If no flex-basis is specified the default is the set width/height value, if width/height isn't specified the default is the width/height of the content<br><br>
                            - When there is not enough space for our flex items our items will shrink at an even rate to fit within the container by default<br><br>
                            - If there is too much space we can declare flex-grow: 1; on our flex items to make them grow at an even rate

                        <td>In the example below, three flex items are contained by a parent flex container. The flex container is only 250 pixels wide so the three 100 pixel wide flex items cannot fit inline. The flex-wrap: wrap; setting causes the third, overflowing item to appear on a new line, below the other two items:<br><br>
                            .container {<br>
                            display: inline-flex;<br>

                        <td>Sometimes, we don't want our content to shrink to fit its container. Instead, we might want flex items to move to the next line when necessary. This can be declared with the flex-wrap property on <u>flex containers</u>. The flex-wrap property can accept three values: <a href="resources/images/flex-wrap.png" title="Click to see an illustrative example" target="_blank">Visual Example when minimized</a><br><br>

                            - <strong>wrap</strong> — child elements of a flex container that don't fit into a row will move down to the next line<br><br>
                            
                            - <strong>wrap-reverse</strong> — the same functionality as wrap, but the order of rows within a flex container is reversed (for example, in a 2-row flexbox, the first row from a wrap container will become the second in wrap-reverse and the second row from the wrap container will become the first in wrap-reverse)<br><br>
                            
                            - <strong>nowrap</strong> — prevents items from wrapping; this is the default value and is only necessary to override a wrap value set by a different CSS rule.

                            - <strong>space-between</strong>: all rows of elements will be spaced evenly from the top to the bottom of the container with no space above the first or below the last.<br><br>
                            
                            - <strong>space-around</strong>: all rows of elements will be spaced evenly from the top to the bottom of the container with the same amount of space at the top and bottom and between each element.<br><br>
                            
                            - <strong>stretch</strong>: if a minimum height or no height is specified, the rows of elements will stretch to fill the parent container from top to bottom (<u>default value</u>).
